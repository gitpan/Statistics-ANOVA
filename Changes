    -all carps now croak
    -nonparam flag for ensuring Friedman test appropriately "dump"-ed
    -cleaned-up ranking operation in Friedman test to handle ties - thanks to Gene Boggs' Statistics-RankCorrelation

    -generalised grand_total calculation within anova_indep which was appropriate only if equal number of observations per group: thanks to Cathal Seoighe for feedback that led to identifying this limitation
    -handling "missing values": added checking and purging of elements that are undefined or NaN before loading; this also reduces the later checks and possible croaks
    -added sub "table" for returning/printing a table of dfs, sums-squares, etc.; pretty formatting still needed ...
