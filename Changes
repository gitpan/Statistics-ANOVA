Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::ANOVA.

0.08 2011/04/19
	-new: confidence intervals computed using pooled estimate of variability over groups (as in calculating MS-within for the ANOVA).
	-correction: paired comparison t-tests following-up the RM ANOVA (called by $aov->compare(independent => 0, parametric => 1)) were not working - thanks to Patrick H. Degnan, Yale, for bringing this to my attention. 

0.07 2010/10/03 ** Important: Several changes that make this version incompatible with v0.062:
	 -new: generic anova() and compare() methods
	-new: independent groups non-parametric method (Kruskal-Wallis), handling ties
	-new: independent "levels" test, of linearity, by parametric and non-parametric (Jonckheere-Terpstra) methods
	-new: dependent "levels" test, of linearity, by non-parametric method (Page test)
	-new: post hoc cluster method, parametric (Scott-Knott) and non-parametric (Worsley)
	-new: nonparametric multiple comparison procedure for nominal independent groups (Dwass procedure)
	-new: options/method for setting alpha and correcting p-value in the means-comparisons procedures. So alpha is .05 by default, but can be set to something else, and instead of the alpha being adjusted according to the number of means compared, the p-values themselves can be adjusted.
	-change: extended correction for ties in Friedman's test per Hollander-Wolfe eq. 7.8
	-change: multiple comparisons now return a hash of relevant values, rather than simply dump to STDOUT; see method compare()
	-change: load() and add() methods now also accept arefs of "name, data" pairs, or a single aref, with the "data" being arefs or not
	-change: unload() method can now be sent one or more names for clobbering particular samples, rather than bombing the lot
	-change: a comma was missing between t_value and p_value in dump of independent comparisons
	-change: no more of these dashes in the dumps: 2-p, 1-p; just 2p and 1p instead
	-change: precisioning handles undefined values
	-change: alphanum order of the pairs in paired comparisons
	-change: clean-up of refs in pod
    -change: the hash keys that were suffixed with "_t" and "_e" (for "treatment" and "error") are now suffixed with "_b" (for "between") and "_w_ (for "within").
	-misc: plenty new tests in "t" folder

0.06x 2008/07/11 - 2009/03/13
	-further work on appropriate handling of missing values and NaNs.
	-generalised grand_total calculation within anova_indep which was appropriate only if equal number of observations per group: thanks to Cathal Seoghie for feedback that led to identifying this limitation
    	-handling "missing values": added checking and purging of elements that are undefined or NaN before loading; this also reduces the later checks and possible croaks
    	-added sub "table" for returning/printing a table of dfs, sums-squares, etc.; pretty formatting still needed ...

0.02-0.05 2008/06/26: 
    	-added sub "add_data" for non-deleting loads; all calls to load unload
    	-all carps now croak
    -nonparam flag for ensuring Friedman test appropriately "dump"-ed
    -cleaned-up ranking operation in Friedman test to handle ties - thanks to Gene Boggs' Statistics-RankCorrelation
    -added F-equivalent output option for Friedman test - thanks to "R" docs
    -cleaned-up POD and dist, with example file
    -removed bung sub fmax for now
